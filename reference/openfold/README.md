# OpenFold

A faithful but trainable PyTorch reproduction of DeepMind's 
[AlphaFold 2](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold).

# Documentation
See our new home for docs at [openfold.readthedocs.io](https://openfold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), with instructions for installation and model inference/training.
